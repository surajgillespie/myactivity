My first web activity for Sugar using the current HTML5 and JavaScript framework


It consists of a Table with a pattern of Colours.
This table will be displayed to the user only for a limited time.
After that the another blank table will be provided to the user to replicate the same pattern as seen in the previous table within a limited time frame.
The user will score points depending on the accuracy of the replication of the pattern.
