Myactivity
==========

My first web activity for Sugar using the current HTML5 and JavaScript framework.

This is more of a test activity to understand the current framework.
I plan to add few more of the below mentioned features as time progresses. 


It consists of a Table with a pattern of colours.
This table will be displayed to the user only for a limited time.
After that the another blank table will be provided to the user to replicate the same pattern as seen in the previous table within a limited time frame.
The user will score points depending on the accuracy of the replication of the pattern.
I plan to add Datastore capability to store the high score for a given user.
Make the UI look more pleasing to the eye and user-friendly.
